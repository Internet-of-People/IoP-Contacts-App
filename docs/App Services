### What is an App Service

App Services are specific communication protocols between end devices. Each service should correspond to an specific task which could be re used
 by other service, creating in this way a tree of more and more complex services solving different situations.

 The architecture was prepared to be Abstract,Agnostic,Plug&Play

 * Abstract and Agnostic: Means that the architecture was built in a way to not be tied to any service or platform, we are not fixing the Libertaria network
  to any technology (blockchain,decentralized file system, profiles network, etc..) and any developer could create his own service and use it on top of the
  Connect library on the App Service layer.

 * Plug&Play: Means that any end device can include a new app service at any time and connect it to the network
 without have to reinstall or configure anything.


 Security:
    For security reasons services only can communicate between each other and the channel has a default configuration.


### How to build an App Service

Have to create a class inside the Connect lib and extend it from the AppService class.

The app service flow is the following:

* onRegistered

* onRegistrationFail

* onPreCal

* onWrapCall

* onCallConnected

* onCallDisconnected


### How to build a Module

Create a class inside the Platform and extend it from the AbstractModule class.


### How to use the App Service on an external app

The way to use it is really simple, you just have to extend the Application class of your android project with the ConnectApplication class and call
the specific method to get your Module, if it was added, if was not added you can use the getModule(Class<T> clazz) with the module interface that you
 are looking for as input. Then you can start using the App Service methods running on the background process.
